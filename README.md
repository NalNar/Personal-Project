# Personal Projects - Tutorial Recreations

This repository contains a collection of personal projects that I have recreated as part of my learning journey.  
Most of these projects are based on online tutorials and courses. The main goal is to reinforce my understanding by building, modifying, and experimenting with code from various learning resources.

## About

- **Learning by Doing:** All projects here are reconstructed from tutorials, guides, or courses I followed.
- **Not Original Creations:** The base structure and logic for most projects are credited to their respective tutorial authors (see attributions below).
- **Personal Modifications:** Where possible, I have added my own improvements, features, or customizations to extend and personalize the projects.
